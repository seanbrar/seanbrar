# Sean Brar

ML systems engineer. [Google DeepMind GSoC 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) alumnus.

I build infrastructure that makes AI practical at scale. My GSoC project—the [Gemini Batch Prediction Framework](https://github.com/seanbrar/gemini-batch-prediction)—reduced API costs 75% through async batching and context caching.

Currently pursuing post-bacc CS/Math, preparing for doctoral research in reinforcement learning and efficient ML systems.
